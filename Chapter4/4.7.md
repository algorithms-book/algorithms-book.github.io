## 4.7. Shortest Paths in DAGs

There are two subclasses of graphs that automatically exclude the possibility of negative cycles: graphs without negative edges, and graphs without cycles. We already know how to efficiently handle the former. We will now see how the single-source shortest-path problem can be solved in just linear time on directed acyclic graphs.

As before, we need to perform a sequence of updates that includes every shortest path as a subsequence. The key source of efficiency is that

* In any path of a $\text{DAG}$, the vertices appear in increasing linearized order.

Therefore, it is enough to linearize (that is, topologically sort) the $\text{DAG}$ by depth-first search, and then visit the vertices in sorted order, updating the edges out of each. The algorithm is given in Figure 4.15.

Notice that our scheme doesn't require edges to be positive. In particular, we can find *longest paths* in a $\text{DAG}$ by the same algorithm: just negate all edge lengths.

  for all u ∈ V:
    dist(u) = ∞
    prev(u) = nil

  dist(s) = 0
  linearize(G)

  for each u ∈ V, in linearized order:
    for all edges (u, v) ∈ E:
      update(u, v)

  return dist
```
