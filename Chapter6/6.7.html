  <h2 id="independent-sets-in-trees">6.7 Independent Sets in Trees</h2>
  <p>A subset of nodes <span class="math inline">\(S \subset V\)</span> is an independent set of graph <span class="math inline">\(G = (V, E)\)</span> if there are no edges between them. For instance, in Figure 6.10 the nodes <span class="math inline">\(\{1, 5\}\)</span> form an independent set, but nodes <span class="math inline">\(\{1, 4, 5\}\)</span> do not, because of the edge between <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>. The largest independent set is <span class="math inline">\(\{2, 3, 6\}\)</span>.</p>
  <div class="figure">
  <img src="fig-6.10-independent-set-example.png" alt="Figure 6.10 The largest independent set in this graph has size 3." />
  <p class="caption"><strong>Figure 6.10</strong> The largest independent set in this graph has size 3.</p>
  </div>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Like several other problems we have seen in this chapter (knapsack, traveling salesman), finding the largest independent set in a graph is believed to be intractable. However, when the graph happens to be a <em>tree</em>, the problem can be solved in linear time, using dynamic programming. And what are the appropriate subproblems? Already in the chain matrix multiplication problem we noticed that the layered structure of a tree provides a natural definition of a subproblem–as long as one node of the tree has been identified as a root.</p>
  <p>So here's the algorithm: Start by rooting the tree at any node <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>. Now, each node defines a subtree–the one hanging from it. This immediately suggests subproblems: <span class="math display">\[I(u) = \text{size of largest independent set of subtree hanging from $u$}.\]</span></p>
  <p>Our final goal is <span class="math inline">\(I(r)\)</span>.</p>
  <p>Dynamic programming proceeds as always from smaller subproblems to larger ones, that is to say, bottom-up in the rooted tree. Suppose we know the largest independent sets for all subtrees below a certain node <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>; in other words, suppose we know <span class="math inline">\(I(w)\)</span> for all descendants <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>. How can we compute <span class="math inline">\(I(u)\)</span>? Let's split the computation into two cases: any independent set either includes <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> or it doesn't (Figure 6.11).</p>
  <p><span class="math display">\[I = \max \begin{Bmatrix} 1 + \sum_{\text{grandchildren $w$ of $u$}} I(w), \sum_{\text{children $w$ of $u$}} I(w) \end{Bmatrix}.\]</span></p>
  <p>If the independent set includes <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, then we get one point for it, but we aren't allowed to include the children of <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>–therefore we move on to the grandchildren. This is the first case in the formula. On the other hand, if we don't include <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, then we don't get a point for it, but we can move on to its children.</p>
  <div class="figure">
  <img src="fig-6.11-independent-set-subtree.png" alt="Figure 6.11 I(u) is the size of the largest independent set of the subtree rooted at u. Two cases: either u is in this independent set, or it isn&#39;t." />
  <p class="caption"><strong>Figure 6.11</strong> <span class="math inline">\(I(u)\)</span> is the size of the largest independent set of the subtree rooted at <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>. Two cases: either <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is in this independent set, or it isn't.</p>
  </div>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The number of subproblems is exactly the number of vertices. With a little care, the running time can be made linear, <span class="math inline">\(O(|V| + |E|)\)</span>.</p>
