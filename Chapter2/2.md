# Divide-and-conquer algorithms

The **divide-and-conquer** strategy solves a problem by:

1. Breaking it into **subproblems** that are themselves smaller instances of the same type of problem

2. Recursively solving these subproblems

3. Appropriately combining their answers

The real work is done piecemeal, in three different places: in the partitioning of problems into subproblems; at the very tail end of the recursion, when the subproblems are so small that they are solved outright; and in the gluing together of partial answers. These are held together and coordinated by the algorithm’s core recursive structure.

As an introductory example, we’ll see how this technique yields a new algorithm for multiplying numbers, one that is much more efficient than the method we all learned in elementary school!
