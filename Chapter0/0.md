Look around you.

Computers and networks are everywhere, enabling an intricate web of complex human activities: education, commerce, entertainment, research, manufacturing, health management, human communication, even war.

Of the two main technological underpinnings of this amazing proliferation, one is obvious: the breathtaking pace with which advances in microelectronics and chip design have been bringing us faster and faster hardware.

This book tells the story of the other intellectual enterprise that is crucially fueling the computer revolution: *efficient algorithms*.

It is a fascinating story. Gather â€™round and listen close.
