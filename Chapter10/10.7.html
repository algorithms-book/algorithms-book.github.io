  <h2 id="the-quantum-algorithm-for-factoring">10.7 The Quantum Algorithm for Factoring</h2>
  <p>We can now put together all the pieces of the quantum algorithm for <span class="math inline">\(\text{FACTORING}\)</span> (see Figure 10.6). Since we can test in polynomial time whether the input is a prime or a prime power, we’ll assume that we have already done that and that the input is an odd composite number with at least two distinct prime factors.</p>

  <p><strong>input</strong>: an odd composite integer <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>.</p>
  <p><strong>output</strong>: a factor of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>.</p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
  <li><p>Choose <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> uniformly at random in the range <span class="math inline">\(1 \leq x \leq N - 1\)</span>.</p></li>
  <li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> be a power of <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> near <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> (for reasons we cannot get into here, it is best to choose <span class="math inline">\(M \approx N^2\)</span>).</p></li>
  <li><p>Repeat <span class="math inline">\(s = 2 \log{N}\)</span> times:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Start with two quantum registers, both initially <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, the first large enough to store a number modulo <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and the second modulo <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>.</p></li>
  <li><p>Use the periodic function <span class="math inline">\(f(a) \equiv x^a \bmod{N}\)</span> to create a periodic superposition <span class="math inline">\(\vert \mathbf{\alpha} \rangle\)</span> of length <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> as follows (see box for details):</p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
  <li><p>Apply the <span class="math inline">\(\text{QFT}\)</span> to the first register to obtain the superposition <span class="math display">\[\sum_{a = 0}^{M-1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{M}} \vert a, 0 \rangle.\]</span></p></li>
  <li><p>Compute <span class="math inline">\(f(a) = x^a \bmod{N}\)</span> using a quantum circuit, to get the superposition <span class="math display">\[\sum_{a = 0}^{M-1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{M}} \vert a, x^a \bmod{N} \rangle.\]</span></p></li>
  <li><p>Measure the second register. Now the first register contains the periodic superposition <span class="math display">\[\vert \mathbf{\alpha} \rangle = \sum_{j = 0}^{M / r - 1} \sqrt{\frac{r}{M}} \vert jr + k \rangle\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is a random offset between <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r - 1\)</span> (recall that <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the order of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> modulo <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>).</p></li>
  </ol></li>
  <li><p>Fourier sample the superposition <span class="math inline">\(\vert \mathbf{\alpha} \rangle\)</span> to obtain an index between <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M - 1\)</span>.</p></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> be the gcd of the resulting indices <span class="math inline">\(j_1, \cdots, j_s\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(M / g\)</span> is even, then compute <span class="math inline">\(\text{gcd}(N, x^{M / 2g} + 1)\)</span> and output it if it is a nontrivial factor of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>; otherwise return to step <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p></li>
  </ol>
  <p>From previous lemmas, we know that this method works for at least half the choices of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, and hence the entire procedure has to be repeated only a couple of times on average before a factor is found.</p>
  <p>But there is one aspect of this algorithm, having to do with the number <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, that is still quite unclear: <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, the size of our <span class="math inline">\(\text{FFT}\)</span>, must be a power of <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. And for our period-detecting idea to work, the period must divide <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>—hence it should also be a power of <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. But the period in our case is the order of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, definitely not a power of <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>!</p>
  <p>The reason it all works anyway is the following: <em>the quantum Fourier transform can detect the period of a periodic vector even if it does not divide</em> <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. But the derivation is not as clean as in the case when the period does divide <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> , so we shall not go any further into this.</p>
  <p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n = \log{N}\)</span> be the number of bits of the input <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. The running time of the algorithm is dominated by the <span class="math inline">\(2 \log{N} = O(n)\)</span> repetitions of step <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>. Since modular exponentiation takes <span class="math inline">\(O(n^3)\)</span> steps (as we saw in Section 1.2.2) and the quantum Fourier transform takes <span class="math inline">\(O(n^2)\)</span> steps, the total running time for the quantum factoring algorithm is <span class="math inline">\(O(n^3 \log{n})\)</span>.</p>

  <p><strong>Quantum Physics Meets Computation</strong></p>
  <p>In the early days of computer science, people wondered whether there were much more powerful computers than those made up of circuits composed of elementary gates. But since the seventies this question has been considered well settled. Computers implementing the <a href="von%20neumann%20architecture%20diagram">von Neumann architecture</a> on silicon were the obvious winners, and it was widely accepted that any other way of implementing computers is polynomially equivalent to them. That is, a <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>-step computation on any computer takes at most some polynomial in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> steps on another. This fundamental principle is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church–Turing_thesis">extended Church-Turing thesis</a>. Quantum computers violate this fundamental thesis and therefore call into question some of our most basic assumptions about computers.</p>
  <p>Can quantum computers be built? This is the challenge that is keeping busy many research teams of physicists and computer scientists around the world. The main problem is that quantum superpositions are very fragile and need to be protected from any inadvertent measurement by the environment. There is progress, but it is very slow: so far, the most ambitious reported quantum computation was the factorization of the number <span class="math inline">\(15\)</span> into its factors <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). And even in this experiment, there are questions about how faithfully the quantum factoring algorithm was really implemented. The next decade promises to be really exciting in terms of our ability to physically manipulate quantum bits and implement quantum computers.</p>
  <p>But there is another possibility: What if all these efforts at implementing quantum computers fail? This would be even more interesting, because it would point to some fundamental flaw in quantum physics, a theory that has stood unchallenged for a century.</p>
  <p>Quantum computation is motivated as much by trying to clarify the mysterious nature of quantum physics as by trying to create novel and superpowerful computers.</p>
