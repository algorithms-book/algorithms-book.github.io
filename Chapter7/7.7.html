  <h2 id="postscript-circuit-evaluation">7.7 Postscript: Circuit Evaluation</h2>
  <p>The importance of linear programming stems from the astounding variety of problems that reduce to it and thereby bear witness to its expressive power. In a sense, this next one is the <em>ultimate</em> application.</p>
  <p>We are given a <em>Boolean circuit</em>, that is, a <span class="math inline">\(\text{DAG}\)</span> of gates of the following types.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p><em>Input gates</em> have indegree zero, with value <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{true}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{false}\)</span>.</p></li>
  <li><p><span class="math inline">\(\text{AND}\)</span> gates and <span class="math inline">\(\text{OR}\)</span> gates have indegree <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>.</p></li>
  <li><p><span class="math inline">\(\text{NOT}\)</span> gates have indegree <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p></li>
  <li><p><span class="math inline">\(\text{NOT}\)</span> gates have indegree <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition, one of the gates is designated as the <em>output</em>. Here's an example.</p>
  <div class="figure">
  <img src="circuit-eval-example.png" />

  </div>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The <span class="math inline">\(\text{CIRCUIT VALUE}\)</span> problem is the following: when the laws of Boolean logic are applied to the gates in topological order, does the output evaluate to <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{true}\)</span>?</p>
  <p>There is a simple, automatic way of translating this problem into a linear program. Create a variable <span class="math inline">\(x_g\)</span> for each gate <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, with constraints <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq x_g \leq 1\)</span>. Add additional constraints for each type of gate:</p>
  <div class="figure">
  <img src="linear-program-gates.png" />

  </div>
  <p> </p>
  <p>These constraints force all the gates to take on exactly the right values—<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{false}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{true}\)</span>. We don't need to maximize or minimize anything, and we can read the answer off from the variable <span class="math inline">\(x_o\)</span> corresponding to the output gate.</p>
  <p>This is a straightforward reduction to linear programming, from a problem that may not seem very interesting at first. However, the <span class="math inline">\(\text{CIRCUIT VALUE}\)</span> problem is in a sense <em>the most general problem solvable in polynomial time!</em> After all, any algorithm will eventually run on a computer, and the computer is ultimately a Boolean combinational circuit implemented on a chip.</p>
  <p>If the algorithm runs in polynomial time, it can be rendered as a Boolean circuit consisting of polynomially many copies of the computer's circuit, one per unit of time, with the values of the gates in one layer used to compute the values for the next. Hence, the fact that <span class="math inline">\(\text{CIRCUIT VALUE}\)</span> reduces to linear programming means that <em>all problems that can be solved in polynomial time do!</em></p>
  <p>In our next topic, <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{NP}\)</span>-completeness, we shall see that many <em>hard</em> problems reduce, much the same way, to <em>integer linear programming</em>, linear programming's difficult twin.</p>
  <p>Another parting thought: by what other means can the circuit evaluation problem be solved? Let's think—a circuit is a <span class="math inline">\(\text{DAG}\)</span>. And what algorithmic technique is most appropriate for solving problems on <span class="math inline">\(\text{DAGs}\)</span>? That's right: dynamic programming! Together with linear programming, the world's two most general algorithmic techniques.</p>
