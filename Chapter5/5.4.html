  <h2 id="set-cover">5.4 Set Cover</h2>
  <p>The dots in Figure 5.11 represent a collection of towns. This county is in its early stages of planning and is deciding where to put schools. There are only two constraints: each school should be in a town, and no one should have to travel more than <span class="math inline">\(30\)</span> miles to reach one of them. What is the minimum number of schools needed?</p>
  <div class="figure">
  <img src="fig-5.11-set-cover-example.png" alt="Figure 5.11 (a) Eleven towns. (b) Towns that are within 30 miles of each other." />
  <p class="caption"><strong>Figure 5.11</strong> (a) Eleven towns. (b) Towns that are within <span class="math inline">\(30\)</span> miles of each other.</p>
  </div>
  <p> </p>
  <p>This is a typical <strong>set cover</strong> problem. For each town <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, let <span class="math inline">\(S_x\)</span> be the set of towns within <span class="math inline">\(30\)</span> miles of it. A school at <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> will essentially &quot;cover&quot; these other towns. The question is then, how many sets <span class="math inline">\(S_x\)</span> must be picked in order to cover all the towns in the county?</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><span class="math inline">\(\text{Set Cover}\)</span></p>
  <ul>
  <li><p><em>input</em>: a set of elements <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>; sets <span class="math inline">\(S_1, \ldots, S_m \subseteq B\)</span>.</p></li>
  <li><p><em>output</em>: a selection of the <span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span> whose union is <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.</p></li>
  <li><p><em>cost</em>: number of sets picked.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p>In our example, the elements of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are the towns. This problem lends itself immediately to a greedy solution:</p>
  <div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">Repeat until <span class="bu">all</span> elements of B are covered:
      Pick the <span class="bu">set</span> S_i <span class="cf">with</span> the largest number of uncovered elements.</code></pre></div>
  <p>This is extremely natural and intuitive. Let's see what it would do on our earlier example: It would first place a school at town <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, since this covers the largest number of other towns. Thereafter, it would choose three more schools—<span class="math inline">\(c, j,\)</span> and either <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>—for a total of four. However, there exists a solution with just three schools, at <span class="math inline">\(b, e,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. The greedy scheme is not optimal!</p>
  <p>But luckily, it isn't too far from optimal.</p>
  <p><strong>Claim</strong> Suppose <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> contains <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> elements and that the optimal cover consists of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> sets. Then the greedy algorithm will use at most <span class="math inline">\(k \ln{n}\)</span> sets.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
  <p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n_t\)</span> be the number of elements still not covered after <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> iterations of the greedy algorithm (so <span class="math inline">\(n_0 = n\)</span>). Since these remaining elements are covered by the optimal <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> sets, there must be some set with at least <span class="math inline">\(n_t / k\)</span> of them. Therefore, the greedy strategy will ensure that <span class="math display">\[n_{t + 1} \leq n_t - \frac{n_t}{k} = n_t (1 - \frac{1}{k}),\]</span></p>
  <p>which by repeated application implies $n_t ≤ n_0 (1 - )^t. A more convenient bound can be obtained from the useful inequality <span class="math display">\[1 - x \leq e^{-x} \ \ \text{for all $x$, with equality if and only if $x = 0$,}\]</span></p>
  <p>which is most easily proved by a picture: <img src="exponential-upper-bound.png" /></p>
  <p>Thus <span class="math display">\[n_t \leq n_0 (1 - \frac{1}{k})^t &lt; n_0 (e^{-1 / k})^t = ne^{-t / k}.\]</span></p>
  <p>At <span class="math inline">\(t = k \ln{n}\)</span>, therefore, <span class="math inline">\(n_t\)</span> is strictly less than <span class="math inline">\(n e^{-\ln{n}} = 1\)</span>, which means no elements remain to be covered.</p>
  <p>The ratio between the greedy algorithm's solution and the optimal solution varies from input to input but is always less than <span class="math inline">\(\ln{n}\)</span>. And there are certain inputs for which the ratio is very close to <span class="math inline">\(\ln{n}\)</span> (Exercise 5.33). We call this maximum ratio the <em>approximation factor</em> of the greedy algorithm.</p>
  <p>There seems to be a lot of room for improvement, but in fact such hopes are unjustified: it turns out that under certain widely-held complexity assumptions (which will be clearer when we reach Chapter 8), there is provably no polynomial-time algorithm with a smaller approximation factor.</p>
