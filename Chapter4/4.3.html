  <h2 id="lengths-on-edges">4.3 Lengths on Edges</h2>
  <p>Breadth-first search treats all edges as having the same length. This is rarely true in applications where shortest paths are to be found. For instance, suppose you are driving from San Francisco to Las Vegas, and want to find the quickest route. Figure 4.5 shows the major highways you might conceivably use.</p>
  <div class="figure">
  <img src="fig-4.5-edge-lengths-example.png" alt="Figure 4.5 Edge lengths often matter." />
  <p class="caption"><strong>Figure 4.5</strong> Edge lengths often matter.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Picking the right combination of them is a shortest-path problem in which the length of each edge (each stretch of highway) is important. For the remainder of this chapter, we will deal with this more general scenario, annotating every edge <span class="math inline">\(e \in E\)</span> with a length <span class="math inline">\(l_e\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(e = (u, v)\)</span>, we will sometimes also write <span class="math inline">\(l(u, v)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(l_{uv}\)</span>.</p>
  <p>These <span class="math inline">\(l_e\)</span>'s do not have to correspond to physical lengths. They could denote time (driving time between cities) or money (cost of taking a bus), or any other quantity that we would like to conserve. In fact, there are cases in which we need to use negative lengths, but we will briefly overlook this particular complication.</p>
