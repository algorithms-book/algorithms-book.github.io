  <h2 id="distances">4.1 Distances</h2>
  <p>Depth-first search readily identifies all the vertices of a graph that can be reached from a designated starting point. It also finds explicit paths to these vertices, summarized in its search tree (Figure 4.1). However, these paths might not be the most economical ones possible. In the figure, vertex <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is reachable from <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> by traversing just one edge, while the DFS tree shows a path of length <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>. This chapter is about algorithms for finding <em>shortest paths in graphs</em>.</p>

  <p>Path lengths allow us to talk quantitatively about the extent to which different vertices of a graph are separated from each other:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>The <em>distance</em> between two nodes is the length of the shortest path between them.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To get a concrete feel for this notion, consider a physical realization of a graph that has a ball for each vertex and a piece of string for each edge. If you lift the ball for vertex <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> high enough, the other balls that get pulled up along with it are precisely the vertices reachable from <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. And to find their distances from <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, you need only measure how far below <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> they hang.</p>

  <p> </p>
  <p>In Figure 4.2 for example, vertex <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is at distance <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, and there are two shortest paths to it. When <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is held up, the strings along each of these paths become taut. On the other hand, edge <span class="math inline">\((D, E)\)</span> plays no role in any shortest path and therefore remains slack.</p>
